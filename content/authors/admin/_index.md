Arin Nelson is an early-career ocean scientist based in Rhode Island.  He is currently a postdoctoral fellow working under Dr. Lewis Rothsteing at University of Rhode Island in collaboration with Baylor Fox-Kemper at Brown University.  His goal is to become a scientific expert on Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay and its adjacent ocean with knowledge in the region's physics, biology, chemistry, geology, and maybe even sociology, and to apply this knowledge in the benefit of those who rely on these waters.
